SW-CLI is a tool for Skate Wizards players to manage their character, their
rolls, and their steeziness from the comfort of their blinking green lines.

## Why?

Three reasons:

1. I queued up this game for a quick work fun night, and it was a pretty solid, low commitment bit of table top fun.
2. I've a growing fondness for not having to leave the comfort of my terminal window
3. I'm having a bit of fun exploring golang.

## Quickstart

- Download a release (not that you can yet)
- Fire up the main interface (can't do this yet either)
- Roll a new Skate Wizard, or select an existing one (can this thing do anything yet?)
- Get ready to chill (Alright. This one's on you.)
